# ⛓️ Blockchain From Scratch

## 🔎 About Repository

This repository contains a simple implementation of a **blockchain built from scratch** in Python.  
It demonstrates the basic concepts of a blockchain, such as:

- Creating blocks
- Proof of Work (PoW)
- Linking blocks with `previous_hash`
- Validating the chain
- Running a minimal blockchain API with **Flask**

⚠️ This project is **only for learning purposes** and not intended for production use (like Bitcoin or Ethereum).
